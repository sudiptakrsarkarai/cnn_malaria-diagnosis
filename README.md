<b>Overview:</b>
This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect and diagnose malaria from cell images. Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial to effectively treat the disease and reduce transmission.

Features:
Dataset: The project uses the "Malaria Cell Images Dataset" which comprises segmented cells from the thin blood smear slide images from the Malaria Screener research activity. This dataset contains a total of two categories: Parasitized and Uninfected.

Data Augmentation: To make the model robust and prevent overfitting, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flip are applied to the training images.

CNN Architecture: The core of this project is a deep learning model with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers designed to extract features from the cell images and classify them.

Visualization: The project includes code to visualize the training process, showcasing metrics like accuracy and loss over epochs.

Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.

Deployment: Guidelines and scripts to deploy the model as a web application or mobile app, allowing end-users to upload cell images and get predictions on whether they are parasitized or uninfected.

Applications:
Healthcare: Can be used in remote areas or regions lacking advanced medical facilities to quickly diagnose malaria.
Research: Helpful for researchers working on malaria to quickly segregate infected samples.
Education: Can be used as a tool to train medical students and professionals about the visual characteristics of malaria-infected cells.
