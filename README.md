<center><b>Overview:</b></center><br>
This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect and diagnose malaria from cell images. Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial to effectively treat the disease and reduce transmission.

<center><b>Features:</b></center><br>
Dataset: The project uses the "Malaria Cell Images Dataset" which comprises segmented cells from the thin blood smear slide images from the Malaria Screener research activity. This dataset contains a total of two categories: Parasitized and Uninfected.<br>

<center><b>Data Augmentation:</b></center><br> To make the model robust and prevent overfitting, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flip are applied to the training images.<br>

<center><b>CNN Architecture:</b></center><br> The core of this project is a deep learning model with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers designed to extract features from the cell images and classify them.<br>

<center><b>Visualization:</b></center><br> The project includes code to visualize the training process, showcasing metrics like accuracy and loss over epochs.<br>

<center><b>Evaluation:</b></center> <br>Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.<br>

<center><b>Deployment:</b></center><br> Guidelines and scripts to deploy the model as a web application or mobile app, allowing end-users to upload cell images and get predictions on whether they are parasitized or uninfected.<br>

<center><b>Applications:</b></center><br>
Healthcare: Can be used in remote areas or regions lacking advanced medical facilities to quickly diagnose malaria.
Research: Helpful for researchers working on malaria to quickly segregate infected samples.
Education: Can be used as a tool to train medical students and professionals about the visual characteristics of malaria-infected cells.<br>
